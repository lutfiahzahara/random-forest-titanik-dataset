## Random Forest Classifier for Titanic Survival Prediction

I use the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to analyze passenger safety factors based on ticket class, gender, and ticket price. With the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach and the Random Forest Classifier model, this project aims to understand safety patterns and improve prediction accuracy.

#### Analysis Objectives:
- To find out the main factors that affect passenger safety
- To see the distribution of safety based on gender and ticket class
- To identify the correlation between ticket price and safety
- To build a prediction model with Random Forest Classifier

#### Results & Findings:

Female passengers and 1st class have a higher chance of safety
There is a strong correlation between ticket price (Fare) and ticket class (Pclass)
The Random Forest model achieves 82% accuracy in predicting passenger safety

#### Recommendations & Evaluation:
- Economy class passengers have a higher risk, need better safety strategies
- The correlation between ticket price and safety can be a reference in travel policies
- The model can be improved with hyperparameter tuning techniques and further engineering features
